========================================

STRINGS.XML

1. Please translate content between <string ...>Something to translate</string>, but only if there is no translatable="false" attribute.
2. Please try to keep translated phrases and sentences in similar lenght to original ones.
3. Don't translate "name" attributes. Just content between ">" and "<".
4. Words like %1$s, %d, %s etc. are parts of format strings. Don't remove it when translating. For example "Last update at %1$s" is a format string used to display last update time and will look like "Last update at 12:37" in the English version of app.

ARRAYS.XML
